Using
=====
The project is not in any public maven repository yet but is available from jitpack.io. 
To use that version add the following to your pom.xml:
```
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.github.SignalK</groupId>
		<artifactId>signalk-server-java</artifactId>
		<!--choose appropriate version-->
		<version>JIT-Deploy-07</version>
	</dependency>
```

Development
===========

The project is developed and built using maven and eclipse. 

You will need to clone the signalk-core-java project and build it with maven , then the signalk-server-java project. 

The default signalk-server-java build will use the most recent jitpack.io signalk-core build, so for dev you need to set the system property in maven as follows. This will cause the builds to use the dev dependencies, from your local repository.

```
mvn -Dsignalk.build=dev install
```

The signalk-core-java project is usable separately and contains the core model, and useful helpers.
